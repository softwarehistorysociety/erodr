A defunct LOCAL social app built by two University of Missouri students in the 20teens.

**From the description of its [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/erodrapp)**:

> erodr lets you discover the college student community around the nation and on your campus. Choose whether to reveal your personality or stay anonymous every time you make a post.
>
> Limit your post visibility by a distance range and gender, choose whether the comments on your posts will be private or public. All posts and messages are ephemeral, thus deleted after expiration, leaving no archived conversations.
>
> Meet and interact with college students nearby through posts, likes, comments and private messages. Get to know your classmates from a whole new perspective!
>
> To get connected to a large open-minded and inclusive community - download erodr now. A new way of social discovery is waiting for you!
