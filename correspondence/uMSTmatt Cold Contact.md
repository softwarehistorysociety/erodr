# u/MSTmatt Cold Contact

Here is my message to Reddit user [u/MSTmatt](https://www.reddit.com/user/MSTmatt/), who authored the "[Get Erodr](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rolla/comments/21lejp/get_erodr/)!" thread that included both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store links.

Howdy! 

This is probably going to seem a bit bizarre, but I am a (self-proclaimed) Software Historian and I grew up in Columbia, MO. 

The other day, I happened to see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/onrzol/need_help_finding_out_the_name_of_an_old_social/) in the local subreddit and well... sorta went a  bit nuts at the fact that I had never heard of Erodr even though I was living here at the time and my longtime girlfriend + the majority of my friends were students at Mizzou while it was apparently popular. (I'm high school class of 2012.)

For someone who spends a lot of time digging around software archives mostly for word processors from the 80s-90s, it was a pretty profound discovery.

Oh! I should note that I am reaching out to you specifically because of [your post (7 years ago lol) in r/Rolla about Erodr](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rolla/comments/21lejp/get_erodr/). I was wondering if you happened to know the whereabouts of its devs or if you have any memories about it you would have fun sharing. 

For the record, I have set up a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/softwarehistorysociety/erodr) for this (which almost certainly no one else will give a single shit about, notably,) which will include the text of this message for the sake of transparency. However, because you'd already be making my day and doing me a big favor by investing any of your time at all, any replies you send will *not* be made public record, there without your explicit permission to do so.

Thanks for your time! I hope this isn't too strange - I'm still not very good at the cold contact thing lol
